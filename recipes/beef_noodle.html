        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Taiwanese beef noodle soup is a noodle soup dish originating from
            Taiwan. It is sometimes
            referred to as "Sichuan Beef Noodle Soup" (四川牛肉麵), especially in
            Taiwan. Although this
            usage can create confusion as Sichuan has its own versions of beef
            noodle soups which may
            be sold at Sichuanese restaurants under the same name. The beef is
            often stewed with
            the broth and simmered, sometimes for hours. Chefs also let the
            stock simmer for long periods
            with bone marrow; some vendors can cook the beef stock for over 24
            hours. In Taiwan, beef
            noodle vendors may also have optional, often cold side dishes, such
            as braised dried tofu,
            seaweed or pork intestine. Beef noodles are often served with suan
            cai (Chinese sauerkraut)
            on top, green onion and sometimes other vegetables in the soup as
            well.

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large saucepan, saute the first four ingredients in the
                oil for 2 minutes. Add the beef and cook until just browned.
            </li>
            <li>Add the wine, soy sauce, water, sugar, and tomato and heat to
                boiling. Reduce to a simmer and cook with the lid on for 2
                hours.</li>
            <li>About 15 minutes before the beef is done, bring a large pot of
                water to boil. Add the pasta and cook while stirring
                occasionally for 3 minutes. Add the napa cabbage and cook for 2
                more minutes. Drain off most of the water.</li>
            <li>Divide the noodles and cabbage among 6 large bowls, adding a
                little of the excess hot water. Add the beef on top and ladle
                in some of the sauce, making sure to remove the star anise.
