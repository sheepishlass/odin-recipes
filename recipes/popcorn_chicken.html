        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Taiwanese fried chicken, westernized as popcorn chicken, is a dish in
            Taiwanese cuisine commonly found as a street snack and in the night
            markets in Taiwan. It consists of bite-sized pieces of chicken, coated
            and fried with flour and seasoning mixture. Salt and pepper is the
            staple condiment, while chili powder, lightly fried basil leaves, and
            garlic bits are added for preference. Since the creation of this dish,
            it has become a popular fast food or restaurant appetizer in other
            countries in Asia, as well as among Asian immigrant populations
            overseas.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For marinating and frying:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 to 2 pounds chicken thighs</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon minced ginger</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Shaoxing rice wine (or sake)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon white pepper</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup sweet potato flour (look for coarse sweet potato flour with
                flakes for better crunch, but if you can't find flour, 2/3 cup
                sweet potato starch, cornstarch, or sweet rice flour mixed with 1/3
                cup cornmeal or Panko will work)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>2 cups neutral-flavored oil, or enough to fill a deep-sided pot or
                wok 1-inch deep</li>
            <li>1 cup basil leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For serving:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon Taiwanese white pepper salt (or 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4
                teaspoon black pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon white pepper)</li>
            <li>Paprika, to taste</li>
            <li>Chinese five-spice powder, to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice chicken thighs into bite-sized pieces. In a medium bowl, toss
                the chicken with the minced garlic, ginger, soy sauce, rice wine,
                white and black peppers, salt, sugar, and five-spice powder until
                well-coated. Let marinate in the refrigerator for at least one hour
                and ideally more (up to overnight).</li>
            <li>When you’re ready to fry, mix sweet potato flour and baking powder
                in a medium bowl. [Sweet potato flour will work best because it has
                coarser bits that fry up crispier, but it’s a little hard to find.
                If you don’t have access to it, sweet potato starch mixed with
                equal parts cornmeal will work well. You could also use cornstarch
                or sweet rice (mochiko) flour. The latter is popular in Hawaii for
                a similar popcorn chicken called mochiko chicken. Either way,
                adding the cornmeal will give the chicken more of a crunch. If you
                don’t have cornmeal, you could try substituting panko.]</li>
            <li>Dredge the chicken pieces in the flour mixture until well-coated.
                If needed, dredge a few times to build up a coating. Let the
                chicken sit for a few minutes so that the coating can adhere -- you
                can do this while the oil is heating. Five to 10 minutes of rest
                time is ideal.</li>
            <li>To fry, heat a generous quantity of oil in a heavy-bottomed pot or
                wok to about 350° to 375° F. If you don't have a deep-fry
                thermometer, drop one piece of chicken into the oil to test: If it
                bubbles steadily, like a gentle simmer, and browns in about a
                minute, it's exactly right; if it boils vigorously, it's too hot;
                and if only a few bubbles appear, it's too cold. Fry about a cup or
                so of the chicken at a time (I like to fry it in a large metal
                strainer so that I can lift all the chicken out at once and don't
                have to worry about burning.) Do not overcrowd the chicken. When
                chicken is golden-brown, remove it and drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li>After all the chicken is fried, turn the heat off and let the oil
                cool briefly. Pat the basil very dry and lower it gently into the
                oil using a metal strainer -- be very careful, as it's likely to
                splatter. When the basil is crisp, use the strainer to remove it,
                drain the basil of excess oil, and toss the leaves with the
                chicken.</li>
            <li>Finally, powder the chicken with Taiwanese white pepper salt (see
                above notes if you can't find it), paprika, and five-spice powder
                to taste, and serve immediately.</li>
