        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The oyster omelette is a dish of Min Nan (Hokkien and Teochew)
            origin that is renowned
            for its savory flavor in its native Minnan region and Chaoshan,
            along with Taiwan and
            many parts of Southeast Asia, such as the Philippines, Thailand,
            Malaysia, Singapore and
            Indonesia, due to the influence of the Hokkien and Teochew
            diaspora.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Taiwanese Oyster Omelet Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons ketchup</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons soy paste (NOT soy sauce); I recommend Kimlan
                brand</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Taiwanese Oyster Omelet</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup tapioca starch</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cold water</li>
            <li>1 cup Chinese greens-- I recommend A-choy; Romaine leaves make
                a good substitute</li>
            </li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground white pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>1 10 oz jar of fresh, shucked oysters, or 4-6 fresh oysters
            </li>
            <li>3 tablespoons canola oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Taiwanese Oyster Omelet Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place all ingredients in a small bowl, and stir until well
                combined. Set aside until the omelet is done-- it will thicken
                as it sits.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Taiwanese Oyster Omelet</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir tapioca starch and water together in a small bowl until
                you have a slurry. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Chop A choy or Romaine leaves into 1/2 inch pieces and set
                aside.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, beat eggs. The tried and true Taiwanese method
                is using chopsticks, and you donâ€™t have to fully combine the
                yolks and whites. Add salt and white pepper. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat.
            </li>
            <li>When oil is shimmery, add the tapioca slurry (careful, it may
                splatter a bit) and reduce heat to medium. Cook for a minute or
                two until the color changes from white to translucent (kind of
                like a jellyfish).</li>
            <li>At this point, reduce heat to low and add beaten eggs. Stir for
                10 seconds with chopsticks until coarsely combined.</li>
            <li>Quickly add oysters and greens on top of eggs and press gently
                to set. Allow to cook, undisturbed, until slightly golden
                around the edges.</li>
            <li>Using two spatulas, carefully flip omelet over in pan. Bring
                heat back up to medium and allow to cook until oysters are
                fully cooked and omelet is set, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve omelet on a plate and drizzle desired amount of sauce on
                top.</li>
        </ol>
